### Wish someone special happy birthday in a special way.

It was a brithday of one of my friend and I wanted to wish her in a special way. So I put together this animated web page real quick to say Happy Birthday.

Feel free to use it to wish your friend if you want to.
You can get it running in a few easy steps:

* Fork the repository
* Edit the HTML content (Replace name/message with your friends name and own message)
* Turn on GitHub pages for the repository (Settings > GitHub Pages)
* Send the URL that you get at the above step to your friend

Please note that I've created this page in a hurry and codes are probably not organised in the best way. It comes with no warrenty, so check yourself before sending it to your friend.

I've used plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) for animations.
