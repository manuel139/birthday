### Wish someone special happy birthday in a special way.

It was a birthday of one of my friend and I wanted to wish her in a special way. So I put together this animated web page real quick to say Happy Birthday.

Feel free to use it to wish your friend if you want.
You can get it running in a few easy steps:

* Fork the repository
* Edit the HTML content (Replace name/message with your friend's name and own message)
* Turn on GitHub pages for the repository (Settings > GitHub Pages)
* Send the URL that you get at the above step to your friend

Please note that I've created this page in a hurry and codes are probably not organized in the best way. It comes with no warranty, so check yourself before sending it to your friend.

I've used plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) for animations.
